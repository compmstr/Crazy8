Computer play animation doesn't seem to run on first move
  *now does animation, but starts it on construction, animation runs out before display*

FIXED:
Still picking suit if going out with an 8
Need to animate not playing card (not just invalid move)
Crash when releasing touch when not dragging card
Computer play animation appears to run multiple times
