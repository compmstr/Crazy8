Computer play animation appears to run multiple times
Computer play animation doesn't seem to run on first move
  *now does animation, but starts it on construction, animation runs out before display*
I got a crash while returning a card to my hand without playing it (only seen once so far)

FIXED:
Still picking suit if going out with an 8
Need to animate not playing card (not just invalid move)
